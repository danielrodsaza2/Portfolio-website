# Portfolio-website
This is the initial website sample I used as a template for my own and its creator:

My process is throughly explained in the "Websiteportfolioprocess.pdf" file contain in the ZIP folder but basically what I did was to start from LiyaÂ´s pen and modify it to create my own portfolio website. The base elements of her websbite I left them eventhough I removed and repalced quite some, as it became easier to create new elemtns and arrange them as i wanted than breaking my head trying to connect the dots of how she strcutured her website.

The result, eventhough is fairly simple is still, for me, really satisfactory. I created header, tables, photos, links from those photos, imported fonts, played and learned around a lot with CSS and created my first ever website completely coded.
